# VariadicWarfare

This was created for the SCEGJ and GENESIS gamejams. The two themes were conflict and space.
I was in particular thinking of writing this game in PHP, however, I decided
because I was learning batch script at the time I found both game jams I'd do
this very idea I had in batch sctipt. Batch script is a little out dated,
but it still has some uses. Initially I was learning it for another project I 
had planned and will likely finish somewhere along the line. In the future, if there's
a sequel of sorts to this, I may use powershell or bash. Mayble I'll use Julia or a Makefile.

Variodic Warfare takes place in an alternate timeline of WW1 after the Battle of Mons.
You play as a solemn boy from Britain going to fight for their country. After Aliens 
[yes, unironically aliens] descend upon the Battle of Mons and take captives from both
sides, your body is altered to accomodate their needs. Soon you are completely reconfigured
for their wars on their battlefields complete with an altered view of the universe.

Armed with a new body, a new world, a new gun, and the same wits you must learn how to 
navigate both philosophically and phisically this new adventure.

Update, March 19th: for now this project is canceled. I have decided that batch, while likely able to do what
I'm trying to do, is far too frustratingly limited. I am interested in returning to this if I decide to
pick up VBS or return to bash. I have learned what I wanted to learn, and I'm happy for that. Now,
I'll work on the project I originally wanted to learn batch for which honestly will probably waste
much less time than I did here.
